Specifically, HHS must negotiate maximum prices for (1) insulin products; (2) with respect to FY2023, at least 25 single-source, brand-name drugs that do not have generic competition and that are among either the 125 drugs that account for the greatest national spending or the 125 drugs that account for the greatest spending under the Medicare prescription drug benefit and Medicare Advantage (MA); (3) beginning in FY2024, at least 50 such single-source, brand-name drugs; and (4) newly approved single-source, brand-name drugs that meet or exceed a specified price threshold and that HHS determines are likely to meet the spending criteria. The negotiated prices must be offered under Medicare and MA and may also be offered under private health insurance unless the insurer opts out.
The negotiated maximum price may not exceed (1) 120% of the average price in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom; or (2) if such information is not available, 85% of the U.S. average manufacturer price. Drug manufacturers that fail to comply with the bill's negotiation requirements are subject to civil and tax penalties.
TITLE II--MEDICARE PARTS B AND D PRESCRIPTION DRUG INFLATION REBATES
The bill also requires drug manufacturers, subject to civil penalties, to issue rebates to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for covered drugs under Medicare that cost $100 or more and for which the average manufacturer price increases faster than inflation.
TITLE III--PART D IMPROVEMENTS AND MAXIMUM OUT-OF-POCKET CAP FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES
The bill reduces the annual out-of-pocket spending threshold, and eliminates beneficiary cost-sharing above this threshold, under the Medicare prescription drug benefit. Additionally, prescription drug plan sponsors must allow certain beneficiaries to make coinsurance payments in periodic installments, in accordance with CMS requirements.
TITLE IV--DRUG PRICE TRANSPARENCY
Drug manufacturers must report, subject to civil penalties, specified information for certain drugs that cost $100 or more and that are covered under Medicare or Medicaid, based on the rate of price or spending increases.

TITLE V--PROGRAM IMPROVEMENTS FOR MEDICARE LOW-INCOME BENEFICIARIES
The bill expands eligibility for certain premium and cost-sharing subsidies for low-income beneficiaries under the Medicare prescription drug benefit. For example, the bill (1) raises the maximum allowable income for beneficiaries to qualify, and (2) allows certain residents of U.S. territories to automatically qualify.

Specifically, HHS must develop a strategy and take associated action to reduce unnecessary costs and administrative burdens in the health care system, including Medicare, Medicaid, and the private health-insurance market, by at least half over a period of 10 years. HHS must also award grants so that states may establish commissions targeting such costs.
TITLE VIII--MISCELLANEOUS
The bill also establishes and revises several other health care programs and requirements.
For example, the bill (1) expands guaranteed issue rights with respect to Medigap policies (Medicare supplemental health-insurance policies); (2) provides specified funds for the Community Health Centers Fund through FY2025; (3) establishes grant programs to support mental health and trauma services in schools, as well as career development programs for health professionals; and (4) requires pass-through pricing models, and prohibits spread-pricing, for payment arrangements with pharmacy benefit managers under Medicaid.
Additionally, the CMS must issue regulations that require direct-to-consumer television advertisements for all covered drugs and biologics under Medicare and Medicaid to include the list price of a 30-day supply or for a typical course of treatment. (On May 10, 2019, the CMS issued a final rule titled Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Regulation to Require Drug Pricing Transparency. The rule requires direct-to-consumer television advertisements for covered drugs and biologics under Medicare and Medicaid to include the list price of a 30-day supply or for a typical course of treatment, if the list price is at least $35 per month. The rule was scheduled to take effect July 9, 2019; however, a federal court blocked implementation, citing a lack of statutory authority.)"

A state and all of its political subdivisions shall be subject to preclearance of voting practice changes for a 10-year period if (1) 15 or more voting rights violations occurred in the state during the previous 25 years; or (2) 10 or more violations occurred during the previous 25 years, at least one of which was committed by the state itself. A political subdivision as a separate unit shall also be subject to preclearance for a 10-year period if three or more voting rights violations occurred there during the previous 25 years.
A state or political subdivision that obtains a declaratory judgment that it has not used a voting practice to deny or abridge the right to vote shall be exempt from preclearance.
All jurisdictions must preclear changes to requirements for documentation to vote that make the requirements more stringent than federal requirements for voters who register by mail or state law.
The bill specifies practices jurisdictions meeting certain thresholds regarding racial minority groups, language minority groups, or minority groups on Indian land, must preclear before implementing. These practices include changes to methods of election, changes to jurisdiction boundaries, redistricting, changes to voting locations and opportunities, and changes to voter registration list maintenance.

20,Died in a previous Congress,"No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2019
This bill modifies provisions relating to federal funding for, and health insurance coverage of, abortions.
Specifically, the bill prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions or for health coverage that includes abortions. Such restrictions extend to the use of funds in the budget of the District of Columbia. Additionally, abortions may not be provided in a federal health care facility or by a federal employee.
Historically, language has been included in annual appropriations bills for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions—such language is commonly referred to as the Hyde Amendment. Similar language is also frequently included in appropriations bills for other federal agencies and the District of Columbia. The bill makes these restrictions permanent and extends the restrictions to all federal funds (rather than specific agencies).
The bill's restrictions regarding the use of federal funds do not apply in cases of rape, incest, or where a physical disorder, injury, or illness endangers a woman's life unless an abortion is performed. The Hyde Amendment provides the same exceptions.
The bill also prohibits qualified health plans from including coverage for abortions. Currently, qualified health plans may cover abortion, but the portion of the premium attributable to abortion coverage is not eligible for subsidies."

(Sec. 3851) This part establishes a new approval process for OTC medications. Specifically, it creates an FDA administrative order process for the evaluation of OTC products, replacing the present notice and comment rulemaking approach.

The bill provides for market exclusivity under certain circumstances. For drugs determined to be generally regarded as safe and effective pursuant to an administrative order requested by a sponsor (rather than initiated by the FDA), the requestor is granted 18 months of market exclusivity.
